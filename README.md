# Vulkan Game Engine

A small engine based on Vulkan(LWJGL3) and Java. Currently it contains mostly utilities for rendering but it should change as the project matures. 

<h2>Instalation</h2>

 <h3>Prepare your IDE</h3>
 
  * Download and install Vulkan from <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home">this</a> site.
  * Download required LWJGL libraries("Minimal Vulkan" + JOML) from <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/download">this</a> page.
  * Create a new project in your IDE.
  * Add the Vulkan libraries to the project.
  * Add <b>Vulkan Game Engine</b> package contents to the project and make sure that your IDE recognizes the source("src") package.
  * If you are using Mac OS you might have to add "-XstartOnTheFirstThread" to the VM arguments and then run the demo again.
  * You are ready to go!
  
  
<h2>Required LWJGL libraries</h2>
<p> It is highly recomended to download default "Minimal Vulkan" preset with JOML selected. You can find it on <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/download">this</a> website. </p>
 

<h2>Contribute!</h2>
<p>Developing fully functional game engine is challenging enough for a team of full time developers. Not to say for a guy that is pursuing bechelor's degree at the same time(and tries to sleep 8 hours a day). So any amount of help is more then welcome!</p>

<h3>Help with documentation!</h3>

  We all make mistakes and it is quite normall that when the program exceeds a few thousands lines of code(and it's documentation) there will be some typos. So if you found any typos please report it through the issues page. I will really aprecieate it.
  
 <h3>Help with demos!</h3>
 There is no such thing as too much demos. If you understand some part of the engine and want to contribute to the project you can create a demo which uses this part of the engine. It doesn't have to be sophysticated! Just experiment if you wish and if you make something interesting please share it with others! 
 
 <h3>Help with configuration!</h3>
  There are quite a few configuration files with the project. And as there are a lot of hardware configurations. It is very likely that some problems with the engine would be possible to solve using just a few small changes in the configuration files. So if you found a issue with the engine that you think can be solve with the configuration files. Feel free to experiment and If you happen to fix the problem share your thoughts and tips with others!
 
 <h3> Help with code! </h3>
  Of course there is the usual way to help with the project. And this is by adding new features to it! So if you found yurself quite comfortable with the project feel free to add some tweeks to it!
